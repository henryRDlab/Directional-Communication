<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >  Nowadays, wireless networks have numerous emerging applications, ranging from backbone wireless mesh networks,
last-mile wireless networks and Wi-Fi direct networks. We can categorize the various application scenarios into two types:
(1) indoor wireless networks and (2) outdoor wireless networks. Indoor wireless networks include last-mile wireless
networks and Wi-Fi direct networks, which usually have shorter links than outdoor wireless networks. Compared with
indoor wireless networks, outdoor wireless networks often serve as the network backbone or the infrastructure for
Internet connection and usually have a longer transmission range. Besides, a data transmission usually traverses
through multiple hops in outdoor wireless networks while it often takes only one hop in indoor wireless
networks.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >  Both indoor and outdoor wireless networks typically consist of the nodes equipped with omni-directional
antennas. Since omni-directional antennas spread radio signals in all directions, all neighbors around a pair
of  communication  nodes  (i.e.,  the  transmitter  and  the  receiver)  are  prevented  from  transmitting  to  avoid
collisions. Therefore, the capacity of wireless networks using omni-directional antenna is limited due to the high
interference and the low spatial reuse. We call such wireless networks using omni-directional antennas as
<span 
class="ptmri7t-">WONs</span>.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >  Many other studies consider using directional antennas instead of omni-directional antennas in both indoor and outdoor
wireless networks. Compared with an omni-directional antenna, a directional antenna can concentrate its transmitting or
receiving capabilities to a certain direction. Thus, using directional antennas in wireless networks allows more concurrent
transmissions in the vicinity of a pair of communication nodes and consequently leads to less interference to other on-going
transmissions. We call such wireless networks using directional antennas as <span 
class="ptmri7t-">DAWNs</span>, which usually have much higher
network capacity than WONs.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >  DAWNs have more benefits than WONs despite many design challenges that restrict the wide application of directional
antennas in wireless networks. Besides, using directional antennas in indoor environments usually leads to more
challenges than that in outdoor environments. Thus, the solutions to indoor DAWNs are quite different from
those to outdoor DAWNs (research issues on indoor DAWNs will be addressed in Section <a 
href="#x1-88r3">V-C<!--tex4ht:ref: indoor --></a>). In this
paper, we mainly concentrate on outdoor DAWNs, but some discussions may apply to indoor DAWNs as
well.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >  There are a number of studies on DAWNs. Most of them are only focused on design and implementation issues of
DAWNs. However, there are few studies offering comprehensive overviews on advances and research challenges on
different layers in DAWNs. Therefore, we present a survey on DAWNs in this paper. In particular, we (i) summarize the
research challenges on different layers of DAWNs; (ii) compare the current solutions and offer implications on DAWNs;
(iii) present prospects for the future studies on DAWNs.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >  More specifically, we categorize the research issues on DAWNs into the following types according to the different
network layers.

     the hidden terminal problem and the deafness problem, which significantly affect the network performance.
     Besides, localization and neighbor discovery also lead to challenges on the MAC design on DAWNs.

<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >  </div><hr class="endfigure">
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >  The classification of various antennas is shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-13r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:class-antenna --></a>. In general, an antenna is a device which is used for
radiating/collecting electromagnetic energy (radio signals) into/from space. Among various antenna types, <span 
class="ptmri7t-">omni-directional</span>
antennas are commonly used in wireless networks. One hypothetical omni-directional antenna, called <span 
class="ptmri7t-">isotropic</span>, is a point in
space that radiates power in all directions equally. This ideal antenna is often taken as a reference model of practical
antennas. A half-wave <span 
class="ptmri7t-">dipole </span>is a practical omni-directional antenna, which has a circular radiation pattern in the <span 
class="ptmri7t-">azimuth</span>
plane or in the <span 
class="ptmri7t-">elevation </span>plane. Since an omni-directional antenna radiates radio signals in all directions,
only a small percentage of them can reach the desired nodes and most of them are scattered into space.
The scattered radio signals can cause interference with nodes within the coverage of the antenna. Besides,
omni-directional antennas have low efficiency in the frequency reuse since a number of channels are required to avoid
interference.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >  A directional antenna is an antenna (directed antenna) or an antenna system (an array of antennas), which can radiate or
receive radio signals more effectively in some directions than in others. There are two kinds of directional
antennas:
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Traditional directed antennas </span>include Helix, Yagi-Uda, aperture horn (e.g. pyramidal, conical horns), reflector
    (e.g. parabolic grid antenna), patch antennas, etc. The beam formed by the antennas is either fixed or adjusted
    to point to a certain direction by mechanical rotation.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize">A <span 
class="ptmri7t-">smart antenna </span>is an antenna array consisting of a set of antenna elements (in a linear, planar or circular array)
    with digital signal-processing capability to transmit and receive adaptively. Compared with traditional directed
    antennas,  smart  antennas  usually  possess  superior  capabilities,  such  as  directional  beamforming,  diversity
    processing, adaptive spatial reusing, etc.</li></ul>
<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >  A smart antenna consists of not only a number of radiating elements but also a combining/dividing network and a control
unit. The control unit that is normally implemented by using a digital signal processor (DSP) is the brain of a smart
antenna. Many terms have been used to refer to smart antennas, which include intelligent antennas, phased array, spatial
processing, digital beamforming, adaptive antenna systems etc. In this paper, we denote all these antennas as smart
antennas.
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >  Smart antennas can be categorized as the following types:
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Switched beam</span>: The antenna beam patterns are predetermined by shifting every antenna element&#8217;s signal phase.
    Weights  for  antenna  elements  which  are  used  to  produce  the  desired  beam  pattern  can  be  locally  saved  in
    memory and instantaneously switched. Figure <a 
href="#x1-14r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:smart-antenna --></a>(a) is an example of switched-beam antennas. The performance
    of  switched-beam  antennas  is  limited  since  the  user  may  not  be  exactly  located  in  the  main  beam  of  the
    antenna.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Steerable single beam antenna </span>(dynamically phased array): In this system as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-14r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:smart-antenna --></a>(b), arbitrary
    beam  patterns  are  formed  on  the  fly.  Besides,  the  radiation  pattern  can  be  adjusted  toward  the  users  while
    directions  toward  interference  sources  are  set  to  be  null  (or  zero),  which  is  called  <span 
class="ptmri7t-">nulling  </span>capability.  These
    techniques can maximize the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Adaptive array</span>: In additional to the nulling capability and the dynamical forming of beam patterns, the radiation
    pattern  can  be  adapted  to  receive  multi-path  signals  by  using  space  diversity  algorithms  and  techniques,  as
    shown  in  Figure  <a 
href="#x1-14r2">2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:smart-antenna --></a>(c).  Moreover,  the  use  of  multiple  adaptive  array  antennas  at  both  the  transmitter  and

Sectored antenna systems are typically used in cellular networks, where a sectored antenna subdivides the area covered by
an omni-directional antenna into sectors. Each sector is regarded as a different cell, which offers a longer range than that of
omni-directional antennas. Sectored antennas can select one or multiple sectors to receive or transmit at a time. In general,
sectored antennas can be treated as switched beam antennas if only one sector is active at a time. This is true if the
sectored antenna has a single interface. In this case, its omni-directional mode and directional mode (details will be
addressed in Section <a 
href="#x1-23r3">II-C<!--tex4ht:ref: da-modes --></a>) have different transmission ranges, though the reception range is the same. If there is an
interface per sector (each antenna), its omni-directional and directional modes have the same transmission
range.

<!--l. 221--><p class="indent" >  In general, directional antennas have two modes to transmit or receive: the omni-directional (Omni) mode and the
directional (Dir) mode. The Omni mode is achieved through turning on all the sectors of switched-beam antennas, adjusting
beam pattern of adaptive array antennas or using an omni-directional antenna. The Dir mode is realized by switching on
one sector of switched-beam antennas or utilizing analog beamforming or digital beamforming of adaptive array antennas.
An antenna in the Dir mode usually has a higher antenna gain than that in the Omni mode. As shown in Table <a 
href="#x1-24r1">I<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:modes --></a>, there are
four combinations for the transmitter (TX) mode and the receiver (RX) mode: (I) both the transmitter and the receiver are
in the Omni mode; (II) the transmitter is in the Omni mode and the receiver is in the Dir mode; (III) the transmitter is in
the D mode and the receiver is in the Omni mode; (IV) both the transmitter and the receiver are in the Dir
mode.
<!--l. 223--><p class="indent" >  Among the four cases, case I usually applies to WONs. Case II rarely happens since the receiver cannot know the
location of the transmitter if it is in the Dir mode. Case III is often assumed in DAWNs since it is easy to solve the
localization problem and the neighbor discovery problem (will be addressed in Section <a 
href="#x1-32r2">III-A.2<!--tex4ht:ref: local:discovery --></a>) when the transmitter is in
the Dir mode and the receiver is in the Omni mode. Case IV is the most preferred mode in DAWNs. This is because the
maximum transmission antenna gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">t</span></sub> and the maximum reception antenna gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">r</span></sub> can be achieved when both the
transmitter and the receiver are in the Dir mode. According to Friss&#8217;s free space equation <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRappaport:2002">33</a>]</span>, the communication range
between the transmitter and the receiver can be maximized in this case. Besides, it requires the minimum power to reach
the given communication range. In addition, when both the transmitter and the receiver are in the Dir mode,
they cause the minimum interference to other nodes. However, scheduling antenna beams to face each other
at the same time in Case IV is still a challenge (details about the solutions will be presented in Section
<a 
href="#x1-32r2">III-A.2<!--tex4ht:ref: local:discovery --></a>).  Most  current  studies  circumvent  the  problem  by  assuming  the  Omni  mode  at  the  receiver(case
III).

<a 
 id="Q1-1-5"></a>
<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >  Compared with omni-directional antennas, directional antennas have the following advantages.
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Lower Interference </span>- At transmitter side, a directional antenna concentrates transmitting signals to one direction,
    which  leads  to  no  interference  or  less  interference  with  other  transmissions.  On  the  other  hand,  at  receiver
    side, a directional antenna can shield interference from other transmitters.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Improved  Spatial  Reuse  </span>-  Compared  with  omni-directional  antennas,  directional  antennas  also  allow  more
    concurrent transmissions in the vicinity of the transmitter or the receiver.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Longer Transmission Range </span>- By focusing radio signals to a certain direction, a directional antenna acquires
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    a  higher  antenna  gain  than  an  omni-directional  antenna,  which  consequently  leads  to  a  longer  transmission
    range (given the same transmission power).
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Reduced  Power  Requirement  </span>-  To  maintain  a  successful  link,  the  minimum  transmission  power  is  inversely
    proportional  to  the  product  of  the  antenna  gains  of  both  the  transmitter  and  the  receiver.  Since  directional
    antennas have higher antenna gains than omni-directional antennas, the use of directional antennas results in
    the reduced power requirement.

<a 
 id="Q1-1-5"></a>
<!--l. 264--><p class="indent" >  Although directional antennas have numerous advantages, there are many research challenges in the physical layer, which
restrict the application of directional antennas from wireless networks.
<!--l. 266--><p class="indent" >
<a 
 id="x1-27r1"></a>
<!--l. 268--><p class="indent" >
<!--l. 270--><p class="indent" >  To enable beamforming and other capabilities, such as nulling to interference and mitigating multipath signals, a
directional antenna must have a powerful processing unit (e.g., DSP unit) and a mighty control unit. It is a challenge to
equip wireless ad hoc networks with directional antennas, where many portable devices only have a low-processing
capability.
<!--l. 272--><p class="indent" >  On the other hand, the bulky physical size of directional antennas brings a challenge to deploy directional antennas to
wireless networks. In general, the antenna gain heavily depends on the number of antenna elements. Every two elements
must be separated by at least a half-wavelength. For example, a 2.4 GHz antenna requires about 8-cm separation between
two elements <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XGuoqing:WiMesh2005">55</a>]</span>. This inevitably leads to bulky size of directional antennas, which makes more difficult to deploy
directional antennas to wireless networks.
<!--l. 275--><p class="indent" >  However, with the evolution of integrated circuit (IC) and wireless communications, more and more inexpensive,
powerful and tiny processing units will be available to the portable devices in wireless networks. For example, a compact
Ultra wideband (UWB) antenna with dimensions of (0.9 cm x 1 cm) is used in the breast imaging system <span class="cite">

href="#XAbbosh:2009">56</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 277--><p class="indent" >
<a 
 id="x1-28r2"></a>
<!--l. 279--><p class="indent" >
<!--l. 281--><p class="indent" >  Although the <span 
class="ptmri7t-">directionality </span>enables directional antennas to concentrate the accepting capability or the sending capability
on a direction and weakening the capability on other directions, it also leads to challenges on upper layers, especially for
MAC layer.
<!--l. 283--><p class="indent" >  One of the challenges brought by the directionality of directional antennas is directional carrier sensing (DCS). In a
typical carrier sensing multiple access (CSMA) MAC protocol, a transmitter must listen to the medium first before it
initiates its transmission in order to avoid collisions with other on-going transmissions. More specially, the transmitter will
compare the signal strength measured from the analog circuit with the given SINR threshold. If the signal strength is
greater than the threshold, it indicates that the medium is busy; otherwise it indicates the medium is available. Different
from omni-directional antennas, which can conduct carrier sensing (CS) easily, DCS is more challenging
due to the directionality of of directional antennas as well as different beamforming mechanisms, which
heavily depend on antenna types. It is feasible for a switched beam antenna (or a sectored antenna) to conduct
DCS since it can determine which sector has the highest signal strength and whether it is greater than the
threshold. For an analog beamforming antenna (belonging to adaptive arrays), DCS is also feasible since
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
it can calculate the direction of signal by conducting <span 
class="ptmri7t-">weighted-sum </span>algorithm at analog circuit. But DCS
is not feasible for a digital beamforming antenna since the weighted-sum operation is done at base-band <span class="cite">
&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XGuoqing:WiMesh2005">55</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 285--><p class="indent" >  Another challenge is how to determine the direction of the receiver or the transmitter. In particular, it is involved with
two sub-problems: (1) localization and (2) neighbor discovery. The first one is to determine the absolute or reference
location of each node in the network. It can be solved by either GPS-based methods or GPS-free methods. The
neighbor discovery is to determine where neighbors of a node are. More specifically, when the transmitter
begins to transmit, it must know the direction of the receiver; when the receiver begins to receive, it must
know the direction of the transmitter. It is easy to solve the neighbor discovery problem when either the
transmitter or the receiver is in the Omni mode. But it is challenging for the case that both the transmitter
and the receiver are in the Dir mode. Detailed discussions on these problems will be presented in Section

antennas have higher antenna gains than omni-directional antennas, thus the transmission range is extended. Moreover,
since the signals are focused on a desired direction, the interference is mitigated and spatial reuse is also improved. The
main drawback of switched beam antennas is that they often have higher cost than omni-directional antennas. The MAC
protocols for switched beam antennas, though are not as complicated as those for adaptive array antennas, have to deal with
more issues than omni-directional antennas. First, when a node is to transmit a packet, it must select a sector (beam). If the

<!--l. 307--><p class="indent" >  Steerable single beam antennas and adaptive array antennas have more advantages than switched beam antennas,
e.g., the further reduced interference and the mitigated multipath fading. However, the MAC becomes more
difficult due to the directional beamforming. In particular, when a receiver equipped with a steerable beam
antenna has no knowledge of the transmitter, it must determine where and when to point to the transmitter.
Furthermore, since the antenna beam of the transmitter is pointed to a specific direction when the transmission
is  in  progress,  it  cannot  know  the  transmissions  from  other  nodes.  It  results  in  the  new  hidden  terminal
problem and the deafness problem (they also happen in the networks with sectored antennas), which will be
described in Section <a

href="#x1-15r2">II-B<!--tex4ht:ref: da-pattern --></a>, an
antenna pattern typically includes a main lobe and several sidelobes and backlobes, which account for nothing but
interference. Generally, there are several approaches dealing with sidelobes and backlobes: (i) simplifying or
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
ignoring side/backlobes, (ii) using the nulling capability of the directional antenna to mitigate the effects of

facilitate the analysis on MAC protocols, they cannot depict the realistic impacts of directional antennas in

&#x00A0;[<a

<!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >  Another technique is the nulling capability of directional antennas, which can reduce the effects of sidelobes. Several
proposed protocols have exploited the nulling capability to reduce the interference and maximize the SINR. In <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

<!--l. 317--><p class="indent" >  Instead of mitigating sidelobes or backlobes, many researchers propose protocols to reduce the effects of sidelobes and

&#x00A0;[<a

for wireless networks with long-distance links. It is shown in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

activate all outgoing links (transmit) or incoming links (receive) at a node even with presence of sidelobes and
back lobes when the power at each link is properly set. This capability of multi-transmit or multi-receive
(but not both) is also named as Multi-Transmit-Receive (MTR) capability, which has been investigated in <span class="cite">

<!--l. 324--><p class="indent" >  As mentioned in Section <a 
href="#x1-23r3">II-C<!--tex4ht:ref: da-modes --></a>, there are the Omni mode and the Dir mode for directional antennas. When a directional
antenna is in the Dir mode, it concentrates its <span 
class="ptmri7t-">directionality </span>to a certain direction and consequently leads to the improved
signal strength and the increased communication range. The increased communication range by using directional antennas
can help reducing the number of hops between the source and the destination. Besides, the increased communication range
can also improve the network connectivity by bridging the disjoint network partitions <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRoy:2003">65</a>]</span> <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBettstetter:ICC2005">39</a>]</span>. When a
directional antenna is in the Omni mode, it can be regarded as an omni-directional antenna, which has a shorter
communication range than that in the Dir mode. Therefore, depending on whether the Dir mode is used at either the
transmitter, or the receiver or both, the transmission range varies from Dir-Omni range to Dir-Dir range.
When both the transmitter and the receiver are in the Dir mode, the transmission range is maximized. The
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
transmission range is shortened when the Omni mode is used at both the transmitter and the receiver. Since the
receiver does not know about any transmission attempts from the transmitter, it has to listen in the Omni mode
when it is idle. Therefore, the range extension is often shortened to the Dir-Omni range. MMAC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

particular, MMAC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

communication within the Dir-Dir range is established. DTRA <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

a synchronized mechanism to schedule the transmitter and the receiver to face each other within Dir-Dir

<!--l. 326--><p class="indent" >  Using directional antennas in DAWNs increases not only the communication range but also the <span

is usually proportional to the communication range. The increased interference range leads to more nodes suffering from
the interference. Therefore, proper power control with directional antennas is necessary for the MAC design on DAWNs.
Takai et al. <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTakai:Zhou">66</a>]</span> propose a preliminary power control scheme in DAWNs, in which they use the reception range control
instead of the transmission range control. Through this way, the range-extended communication will not interfere with
on-going communications. It is also shown in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

economic factors of GPS devices, the self-limitations of GPS devices have restrained the application of GPS devices
from wireless networks. Firstly, expensive receivers are needed to be mounted on GPS devices since the

usually cannot work indoors. Moreover, the inquiry of destination position produces additional traffic load <span class="cite">

propagation environments make RSSI methods unreliable. The major drawback of ToA and TDoA measurements is
that  a  small  measurement  error  can  cause  a  large  estimation  error  due  to  the  high  propagation  speed  of

the ultrasound signal. AoA measurement uses directional antennas to estimate the angle of arrival of the
received signal from a beacon node. The main limitation for the AoA method is the possibility of error in
estimating the directions caused by multipath reflections. The protocols that utilize AoA or DoA schemes include

the informed discovery, a node can get location information of other neighbors by AoA caching <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

&#x00A0;[<a

whether the signal is intended for the node. The cache will be updated or invalidated if the neighboring
nodes are moving away or dead. The drawbacks of this method include the low effectiveness of capturing
neighbor information and refreshing caches too frequently due to the mobility of nodes. The study <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XKorakis:Jakllari">12</a>]</span> uses
the location table to store the neighbors directions through overhearing RTS or CTS frames. This method
is similar to AoA caching and has the same limitation as AoA caching. Vasudevan et al. <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XVasudevan:Kurose">70</a>]</span> propose a
gossip-based algorithm in which nodes can discover their one-hop neighbors through scattering the location
information based on a certain probability. The simulation results show that the gossip-based algorithm is much
faster than directed-discovery schemes including AoA caching and location table maintenance although this
algorithm only works in static networks. The schemes such as AoA caching, location table maintenance
and gossip-based algorithm only consider neighbor discovery under the Omni-Omni mode or the Dir-Omni
mode.

<!--l. 376--><p class="indent" >  The non-informed discovery (blind discovery) is far more challenging than the informed discovery. In the blind
discovery, a node can only choose the Dir mode to transmit and receive. Therefore, it is hard to let nodes to know each

receive beamforming (TR-BF) is proposed in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRamanathan:2005">31</a>]</span>. As shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-34r5">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:blinddiscovery --></a>, at a pre-reserved time, each node
alternates randomly between sending heartbeats in one direction and listening to such heartbeats in the opposite
direction. In each round, this method can help a number of pairs find each other, e.g., pairs (A, B), (C, E), (D,
F) and (G, I), as shown in Figure <a

limited rounds of location information exchange. Similar scanning algorithms <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

address the neighbor discovery. However, the existing schemes assume strict synchronization on each node,
which may require a common clock source usually obtained from a GPS receiver. It is challenging to obtain
strict synchronization in distributed wireless networks. Besides, synchronized TR-BF works well in static
networks. However, it will take more rounds for nodes to find each other when nodes are moving. Thus, to
design a blind neighbor discovery scheme without synchronization in mobile environments is still an open
issue.

the reception range of the receiver will interfere with the receiver, which are called the hidden nodes. On
the other hand, the nodes within the range of both the transmitter and the receiver are called the exposed
nodes, which suffer from suppression of the transmission between the transmitter and the receiver. Due to
the directionality of directional antennas and the directional transmission/reception regions (different from
omni-directional antennas), the new location-dependent carrier sensing problems arise in DAWNs. More
specifically, those problems include the new hidden terminal problem, the exposed terminal problem, the deafness
problem, the deaf zone problem and the head-of-line blocking problem, which will be depicted in details as
follows.
<!--l. 391--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-">The hidden terminal problem</span>
<!--l. 393--><p class="indent" >  A hidden terminal is a node that is not aware of another on-going transmission and whose transmission (including
RTS/CTS/ACK control frames and data frames) can cause collisions with the on-going transmission. There are two kinds of
new hidden terminal problems due to the directionality of directional antennas: (i) the hidden terminal problem
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
due to the asymmetry in antenna gains; (ii) the hidden terminal problem due to the unhearing of RTS/CTS
frames.
<!--l. 397--><p class="indent" >  The first kind of hidden terminal problem originates from <span 
class="ptmri7t-">the asymmetry in antenna gains</span>. As shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-36r6">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hidterm1 --></a>, there
are 4 idle nodes: A, B, C and D in the Omni mode with antenna gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sub>. Firstly, node B sends a Directional RTS (DRTS)
to node C and node C replies with a Directional CTS (DCTS). Assume that node A is still in idle mode and
far enough away from node C, node A may not hear the DCTS from C since the omni-directional gain
<span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sub> is smaller than the directional gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">d</span></sub>. Then nodes B and C begin data transmission by pointing their
transmission and reception beams to each other with a gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">d</span></sub>. While the transmission between B and C is
in progress, node A has data destined for node D. Node A points its directional beam toward node D to
sense the channel and detects the channel in idle. Therefore, it sends a DRTS to node D. Since node C is
receiving in the Dir mode with a gain <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">d</span></sub>, it is quite possible that the DRTS from node A interferes with the
transmission from node C. Node A becomes the hidden terminal to node B and node C. In other words, a
transmitter in the Dir mode (with <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">d</span></sub>) and a receiver in the Omni mode (with <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">o</span></sub>) may be out of each other&#8217;s
range, but they may reach each other if they both transmit and receive directionally (with <span 
class="cmmi-10">G</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">d</span></sub>). This kind of
hidden terminal problem arises due to different gains with the Omni mode and the Dir mode of directional
antennas.

However, node A cannot hear it since A is beamformed in the direction of node D. When the communication between node
B and node C is in progress, assume that node A has finished the transmission to node D and has a packet to send to node
B. Node A&#8217;s DNAV (Directional Network Allocate Vector) indicates that the channel toward node B is free when node B is
sending data frames to node C. Therefore, node A begins to send a RTS frame to node B, and it will lead to a collision
with node B&#8217;s transmission. This kind of hidden terminal problems will not happen with omni-directional
antennas since node B will be aware of the transmission of node A and defer the transmission with node
C.

<!--l. 417--><p class="indent" >  The exposed terminal problem in DAWNs is a problem in which two transmissions are not allowed to
proceed simultaneously, i.e., one transmission is suppressed by another one. even though they will not collide
with each other. Directional antennas may cause more nodes exposed to interference due to the increased
transmission range. Take Figure <a 
href="#x1-40r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:exposedterm-dnav --></a> (a) as an example. Nodes E, F and B become the exposed terminals to nodes A
and C when they are within the coverage of nodes A and C. The exposed terminal problem leads to fewer
concurrent transmissions and lower spatial reuse. In particular, as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-40r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:exposedterm-dnav --></a>, node B is blocked
from communicating with node D by the transmission between nodes A and C while the communication
between nodes B and D will not interfere with that one between nodes A and C. The phenomenon becomes
noticeable when the transmission range is further increased and more nodes are covered by the antenna
beams. However, using DNAV (directional Network allocation Vector) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

the impact of the exposed terminal problem. Consider Figure <a 
href="#x1-40r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:exposedterm-dnav --></a> (a) as an example again, where node B&#8217;s
DNAV records the directions of nodes A and C as the forbidden directions. But the direction toward node
D is still available and B can transmit with D. More specifically, the directions (the regions with dashed
lines) of node B as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-40r8">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:exposedterm-dnav --></a> (b) are blocked from transmission while the white directions are still
available. Similarly, nodes E and F are available to other directions except for those toward nodes C and A,
respectively.

<!--l. 434--><p class="indent" >  The deafness problem, first addressed in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XChoudhury:Yang">53</a>]</span>, arises due to directional beamforming. In particular, the deafness is
caused when a transmitter fails to communicate to its intended receiver when the intended receiver is beamformed toward a
direction away from the transmitter. As an example, consider Figure <a 
href="#x1-44r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:deafness --></a>. Node C has data frames destined for node B and it
will choose to use the route through node A. When A obtains a data frame from C, it beamforms toward B and forwards
the frame to node B. At this time, C is unaware of the transmission between A and B since it cannot receive the
directional RTS frame from node A. If it initiates the next transmission with a RTS frame to A, C will not
receive the CTS reply from A since A is beamformed to B. According to the current schemes based on
back-off mechanism of IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XIEEE:WIFI">73</a>]</span>, node C retransmits the RTS
when A does not respond. This process will go on until the RTS retransmitting limit has been reached. This
excessive control frame retransmission will cause the waste on the network capacity. Since C would increase its
back-off interval on each attempt (as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-44r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:deafness --></a>(c)), the deafness problem may result in unfairness as
well.

beamforming toward node B and sending a RTS request. However, the antenna beam of node B is pointed to
node D since node B is also sending a RTS request. Similarly, node C is also beamforming toward node A
and the antenna of node D is adjusted toward node C. Since each node is deaf to each other, a deadlock is
caused.

node is in idle mode. Take Figure <a

C located between A and B becomes deaf to other nodes, e.g., node D. This is because node C can only

<!--l. 488--><p class="indent" >  The HOLB problem arises due to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner in wireless networks. In particular, the HOLB
problem happens when the transmission direction of the foremost data packet in a node&#8217;s transmission queue is blocked due
to the DNAV blocking or the deafness problem. However, other data packets in the queue should not be blocked as their
transmission directions may not be blocked. Take Figure <a 
href="#x1-46r11">11<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hlob --></a> as an example, in which there are four nodes A, B, C and D
equipped with directional antennas. There are three packets queued at node C. Two of them are destined for node B and
one is destined for node D. Since the packets destined for B must be routed through A, A begins transmission with B after
beamforming toward B. In this case, node A becomes deaf to node C. Thus, all the packets destined for node B
from node C have to be blocked due to the deafness of node A. However, since the direction of node C
to node D is not blocked, node C should not block the packet destined for node D and should transmit it
instead.

<!--l. 509--><p class="indent" >  Circular-DMAC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XKorakis:Jakllari">12</a>]</span> attempts to address both the hidden terminal problem and the deafness problem by sending
sequential directional RTS frames through each antenna beam before transmitting data frames, as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-50r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:circularDMAC --></a>.
In this way, the deafness problem can be solved. Consider the example as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-44r9">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:deafness --></a>. Node C is
notified by RTS frames from node A and therefore it will not transmit RTS toward node A. In addition,
the hidden terminal problem due to the asymmetry in antenna gains may be partially solved since some
nodes outside the range of Directional CTS may be reached by Directional RTS. However, this protocol may
not mitigate all the hidden nodes due to the asymmetry in antenna gains since the Dir-Dir range may be
much greater than the Dir-Omni range. Besides, Circular-DMAC cannot solve the hidden terminal problem
due to the unhearing of RTS/CTS frames. For example, as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-37r7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hidterm2 --></a>, node A cannot hear either
RTS frames from node B and CTS frames from C since its antenna is pointed toward node D. Another
drawback of Circular-DMAC is the significant extra overhead caused by transmitting multiple RTS frames for
each data frame. As shown in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XKorakis:Jakllari">12</a>]</span>, under low traffic load, Circular-DMAC performs poorer than IEEE
802.11.

href="#XGossain:2006">14</a>]</span> propose an improved MAC protocol (MDA) based on Circular-DMAC. Although the deafness region
is mitigated by sweeping multiple RTS and CTS frames in opposite directions, the deafness problem can not be solved
completely. Besides, MDA also requires sending multiple RTS and CTS frames before each data transmission, which brings
additional overhead.

problem, the deafness problem and the deaf zone problem. Multiple RTS or CTS frames are used before a data
communication in order to avoid the possible collisions. In addition to DNAV (used to avoid collisions), a
deaf neighbors table (DNT) is proposed to mitigate the deafness. However, DMAC-DA also shares some
common  drawbacks  of  Circular  DMAC  and  MDA,  i.e.,  transmitting  multiple  RTS/CTS  frames  for  each

href="#XKolar04avoidinghead">76</a>]</span> based on the greedy priority scheduling
is proposed. This MAC protocol establishes an interlinking queue (IQ) and a MAC queue with different
packet priorities. In this protocol, the packet with the least wait time is always scheduled first. Simulation
results show this protocol can significantly improve the network performance in terms of the throughput and
the  end-to-end  delay.  However,  this  protocol  requires  making  significant  modifications  on  MAC  since  it
requires maintaining multiple queues in MAC layer. Angular MAC (ANMAC) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XUlukan:2008">77</a>]</span> has solved the HOLB
problem by using a location based scheduler. In particular, packets are enqueued in a queue, if the packet
at  the  head  of  the  queue  is  destined  for  to  a  busy  node,  the  scheduler  will  schedule  the  next  packet  for
transmission. Similar to <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XKolar04avoidinghead">76</a>]</span>, ANMAC requires make some modifications on MAC. Besides, ANMAC also
requires transmitting multiple control frames (e.g., AN-RTS, AN-CTS) for a single data transmission, which
may lead to additional overheads. Selectively Directional MAC (SDMAC) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XPan:2009">78</a>]</span> offers a similar solution to
ANMAC by scheduling the packets in the queue. OPP (opportunistic) MAC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

ANMAC by modifying the FIFO queue as a link list so that the scheduler can directly schedule the next
un-blocked packet to transmit. However, most of current solutions just modify the queue scheduling mechanisms
at MAC to avoid the blocked packets in the queue. Other scheduling schemes are expected in the future
studies.

its antenna to the updated direction of B and <span

separate antennas: an omni-directional antenna and a steerable single beam antenna. Therefore, there are the Omni mode
and the Dir mode for each node. Since the gain of directional antennas is greater than that of omni-directional antennas,
directional antennas acquire a longer transmission range than omni-directional antennas. When both the transmitter and the
receiver are in the Dir mode, the maximum communication range is achieved. However, it is very difficult to let both the
transmitter and the receiver face each other when both of them are in the Dir mode. The difficulty lies in negotiating with
the transmitter and the receiver and making an appointment on when and where to point the antenna toward each
other.

<!--l. 598--><p class="indent" >  To solve this non-informed discovery, the synchronized TR-BF scheme is proposed while it requires strict time
synchronization in the whole network, which is extremely difficult in wireless ad hoc networks. MMAC solves this problem
in an alternate way without synchronization. MMAC establishes the Dir-Dir link between the transmitter
and the receiver by forwarding multi-hop RTS frames to the receiver through multiple Dir-Omni links. In
particular, as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-58r16">16<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:DDrouting --></a>, the Dir-Dir link consisting of node A and node B cannot be directly reached
since they do not know each other at first. Node A initiates a routing request (a Directional RTS frame)
toward node B through the established route through node C and node D, where links A-C, C-D and D-B are
the Dir-Omni links. The DRTS frame is attached with the channel reservation information including the
direction of node A and the time when node A wants to establish the link. When the DRTS frame is finally
received by node B, node B will adjust its antenna toward node A at the time as they have negotiated before.
Therefore, through the multiple RTS forwarding, a Dir-Dir link is established. In spite of the range extension
to the Dir-Dir range, the multi-hop RTS scheme requires more complex upper layer support (such as link
characterization and proactive routing). Moreover, forwarding multiple RTS frames causes additional overhead on the
performance.

<!--l. 612--><p class="indent" >  In addition to the directional transmission of RTS/CTS control frames and data frames, transmitting tones
omni-directionally or directionally can avoid collisions and solve both the hidden terminal problem and the deafness

href="#XChoudhury:deafness">17</a>]</span> and BT-DMAC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBTDMAC:2007">18</a>]</span> are based on sending tones to avoid collisions. In particular,
ToneDMAC transmits an out-of-band tone through the same antenna after the transmission is over. This mechanism can
decrease the probability of the transmission failure and increase the channel utilization. However, it cannot reduce the
cost due to retransmitting RTS frames since a node will not inform its neighbors until the transmission is
completed. In BT-DMAC, when the transmission is in progress, both the sender and the receiver will turn on their
omni-directional busy tones to protect the on-going transmission. By combining with DNAV, the scheme almost
mitigates the hidden and the deafness problems completely. However, an additional omni-directional antenna is
required.

of the antenna and obtain an better performance than WONs. Different from ToneDMAC and BT-DMAC, the tones of

<!--l. 616--><p class="indent" >  Tones have many benefits, such as lower performance overhead than RTS/CTS control frames. However, unlike

<!--l. 692--><p class="indent" >  The complicated collision avoidance mechanisms (RTS/CTS or tones) are required to avoid collisions for random access
control protocols while other MAC protocols can also avoid collisions through reserving the channel or TDMA scheduling
schemes.
<!--l. 698--><p class="indent" >  Receiver-oriented multiple access (ROMA) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBao:2002">62</a>]</span> assumes to use multi-beam adaptive array (MBAA), which can form
multiple beams for several simultaneous receptions or transmissions, and consequently increase the spatial reuse. By
exchanging control frames such as RTS/CTS before each transmission, ROMA determines the communication
pair  and  pre-arranges  a  set  of  timetables  for  individual  nodes.  Each  pair  of  nodes  is  scheduled  with  the
predetermined time slots, thus the transmissions are almost collision-free. Another benefit of ROMA is that
both transmitters and receivers are allowed to use the Dir mode, which leads to a longer transmission range
and a higher spatial reuse over the Dir-Omni mode. The hidden terminal problems are also solved in this
protocol.
<!--l. 700--><p class="indent" >  Zhang <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XZhang:IEEEnetwork2005">63</a>]</span> proposes a directional transmission and reception algorithm (DTRA) in wireless ad hoc networks. Each
node is assumed to be equipped with a steerable antenna. In DTRA, time is divided into frames and each
frame  is  split  into  3  sub-frames:  one  sub-frame  is  used  for  neighbor  discovery  and  3-way  handshaking,
another one is devoted to reconfirming connection and reserving data frames, and the final sub-frame is
used for the actual data transmission. One of DTRA&#8217;s key features is the scanning algorithm for neighbors
discovery, which is quite similar to synchronized TR-BF <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRamanathan:2005">31</a>]</span>. It is shown in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XZhang:IEEEnetwork2005">63</a>]</span> that DTRA requires at
most <span

class="cmsy-10">&#x2309; </span>scans for any two nodes to find each other (if they can reach each other), where <span 
class="cmmi-10">N </span>is the
maximum number of nodes in the network. During the neighbor discovery process, transmitters and receivers can
exchange messages for possible transmission in the next step by a 3-way handshaking algorithm. Reservation
confirmation is quite like the 3-way handshaking process in neighbor discovery except for the different messages
contents.
<!--l. 704--><p class="indent" >  A directional MAC protocol based on the time synchronization mechanism, called SYN-DMAC is proposed in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XWang:2008">58</a>]</span> to
tackle the deafness problems and the hidden terminal problem. SYN-DMAC also divides a transmission cycle into three
phases: random access phase, data phase and ACK phase. Random access phase serves as channel reservation and route
discovery (including neighbor discovery). During the channel reservation, an improved shaking-hand mechanism based on
RTS-CTS-CRTS is proposed while a new control frame CRTS (Confirmed RTS) is used. After the random access phase,
multiple collision-free data transmissions proceed in parallel. Similar to data transmission phase, parallel ACK
transmissions are also contention-free. In SYN-DMAC, nodes have a shorter vulnerable time to the deafness and the hidden
terminals. However, the hidden terminal and the deafness problem cannot be solved completely during the random access
phase.
<!--l. 706--><p class="indent" >  A new MAC protocol, called 2P, is proposed for 802.11 mesh networks with long-distance links, though this scheme can
potentially be used in multi-hop networks <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRaman:Chebrolu">28</a>]</span>. Each node in this network is equipped with a parabolic
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
grid  directional  antenna  (i.e.,  a  kind  of  the  traditional  directed  antennas)  and  multiple  transmissions  are
allowed in each node. Sidelobes of the antenna are considered in the protocol. When sidelobes exist, the
experiments verify that it is still possible to transmit along all links of a node simultaneously (SynTx) or
receive along all links of a node simultaneously (SynRx), under appropriate power settings. The 2P MAC
protocol operates by switching each node between the two phases, i.e., SynRx and SynTx. When switching
from SynRx to SynTx, the node&#8217;s neighbors have to switch from SynTx to SynRx, and vice versa. This
protocol is implemented in firmware and involves very little modifications to the 802.11 chipset, thus it
has low cost. The carrier-sense based backoff and ACK are turned off to enable the SynTx/SynRx. The
simulation results show that 2P can perform several times better than CSMA/CA in a long-distance 802.11 mesh
network.
<!--l. 708--><p class="indent" >  Compared with the random access schemes, the reservation/scheduling MAC protocols are more promising in DAWNs
since these protocols offer almost collision-free solutions. The challenge with the reservation/scheduling MAC protocols lies
in designing the complexed synchronization schemes in distributed wireless networks.

not been well solved (the solutions are either too complicated or have significant performance overheads).

networks.

are mainly used to increase the signal strength or extend the communication range. For example, the long-distance wireless
networks <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

bulky DCF mechanisms might bring more benefits since the DCF mechanism contributes nothing but overheads when the

<!--l. 862--><p class="indent" >  In addition to the above MAC issues, the mobility should be taken into account in the future as well.
In general, the mobility with directional antennas is mainly involved with vehicular communications. In
particular, vehicular communications can be categorized into two types: (i) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and (ii)
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V). Some previous studies <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNavda:2007">88</a>]</span> <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSubramanian:2008">89</a>]</span> have addressed the directional communication on
V2I. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few studies on the directional communication on
V2V.
<!--l. 864--><p class="indent" >  One of the challenges on V2V is how to maintain the directional antennas functioning under the high-speed
environments. The current approaches, such as the beam locking/unlocking scheme and the AoA caching mechanism <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTakai:Martin">52</a>]</span>
may not work well in the high-speed directional V2V communications. One of the limitations of the beam
locking/unlocking mechanism is that it is hard to lock the beams when nodes are moving in a high speed <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTakai:Martin">52</a>]</span>. Besides,
the beam locking/unlocking scheme may not be applicable to the complex network topologies, e.g., a node is making a
turn. Consider Figure <a 
href="#x1-66r17">17<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:beamlocking2 --></a> as an example. Suppose nodes A and B have locked their antenna beams while they are moving in
a highway. When node A makes a right turn (A&#8217; in Figure <a 
href="#x1-66r17">17<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:beamlocking2 --></a>) and node B is still moving forward (B&#8217; in Figure
<a 
href="#x1-66r17">17<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:beamlocking2 --></a>), both nodes A and B must unlock their beams and adjust their beams to the new directions. It is very
difficult to achieve this in very short time. Moreover, AoA caching scheme also suffers from the frequent
invalidation of caches due to the mobility of nodes. Similarly, the location table based approach may become
less  effective  in  mobile  environments  as  well.  Furthermore,  the  mobility  also  brings  challenges  to  blind
discovery, e.g., it takes more runs for the beam-scanning algorithm to help nodes find each other when nodes are

<!--l. 902--><p class="indent" >  The routing in wireless ad hoc networks is more challenging than that in wired networks or wireless networks with
infrastructure (e.g., wireless LAN) since nodes in decentralized networks have no knowledge about the network topology
and therefore they have to establish the routing paths in ad hoc manner. Most of current ad hoc routing protocols are
mainly focused on WONs. Some current studies on DAWNs directly borrow routing protocols in WONs
since they treat the routing layer of DAWNs as transparent. In fact, the routing in DAWNs is much different
from WONs in the following aspects: (1) sweeping delay of directional antennas, (2) directional neighbor
discovery and (3) impacts of location-dependent carrier sensing problems. Such differences imply that ad
hoc routing protocols in WONs may not be appropriate for DAWNs. In Section <a 
href="#x1-69r1">IV-A<!--tex4ht:ref: impacts-routing --></a>, we introduce the
impacts of directional antennas on ad hoc routing. Section <a

<!--l. 913--><p class="indent" >  Most of current ad hoc routing protocols in WONs require that nodes flood the network with the request messages by
broadcasting. But to emulate omni-directional broadcasting with directional antennas requires that a node
<span 
class="ptmri7t-">sweeps </span>its antenna beams in all directions and sequentially transmits multiple requests to its neighbors, which
leads  to  much  higher  delay  than  omni-directional  antennas.  Consider  Figure  <a 
href="#x1-50r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:circularDMAC --></a>  as  an  example,  where  a
node is equipped with an antenna with 8 beams. To broadcast route request packets in all directions, a node
needs to sequentially transmit the same packet over its 8 beams, as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-50r12">12<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:circularDMAC --></a> (a). Therefore, the
delay caused by sweeping the beams sequentially is almost 8 times higher than the delay of omni-directional
antennas<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-71f1"></a> .
<!--l. 915--><p class="indent" >  Moreover, the sweeping delay is increased with the increased number of beams. In general, the narrower the antenna
beam is, the longer the antenna can reach and the less interference it can cause. However, the narrower beam antenna also
means that it has the more number of beams, which leads to higher sweeping delay than the wider beam antenna.
Therefore, sweeping delay seems to counteract the benefits of narrow-beam antennas more or less. The sweeping delay
of directional antennas have to be considered in the design of ad hoc routing protocols in DAWNs in the
future.

Dir-Omni link; (3) Dir-Dir link. Among them, Omni-Omni links and Dir-Omni links are easy to be established since the
receiver in the Omni mode can easily obtain the direction of the transmitter through estimating AoA. However, to establish
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Dir-Dir links is extremely challenging since it requires both the transmitter and the receive to direct their antennas

(routing request) packet is sent omni-directionally from node A through B to node C, the route through
A-B-C has a hop count 2. If directional antennas are considered, then the RREQ packet is sent directionally
from node A. It is quite possible that node A can directly reach node C since a directional antenna has a
higher gain than an omni-directional antenna. Therefore, a short route A-C is established, which has a hop
count 1. Using directional antennas in ad hoc routing can consequently reduce the routing delay due to the
multi-hop routing. It is proved theoretically in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

href="#x1-75r19">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hidterm1-routing --></a>, there is a routing path
A-B-C-D. Node A and node B can communicate with each other through a Dir-Omni link since they are within the
Dir-Omni range of each other. Similarly, nodes B and C form a Dir-Omni link and nodes C and D form a Dir-Omni link.
Note that in this scenario, nodes A and D can reach other through a Dir-Dir link although they are outside of the Dir-Omni
range of each other (as we have discussed in Section <a 
href="#x1-35r3">III-A.3<!--tex4ht:ref: hid-deafness --></a>). Thus, node A is the hidden node to node D due to the
asymmetry in antenna gains. Suppose node A has data packets to node D: DATA(1) and DATA(2) as shown in Figure <a 
href="#x1-75r19">19<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:hidterm1-routing --></a>.
DATA(1) has been transmitted earlier than the packet DATA(2) since link B-C cannot be active at the same time as
link A-B and link C-D while link A-B and link C-D can be active simultaneously. It is quite possible that
the transmission of DATA(2) from node A will collide with the reception of DATA(1) at node D. This is
because node A is the hidden node to node D when link A-B and link C-D are simultaneously active. To
avoid the collisions, DATA(2) should be deferred at least after DATA(1) is successfully received at node
D.  The  hidden  terminal  consequently  leads  to  the  degradation  on  the  routing  performance.  But  it  is  not
the case when using omni-directional antennas since node A and node D are not hidden terminals to each

both C and D have data packets destined at node B. Suppose node C initiates its transmission first and A
will help forwarding C&#8217; packet. When A is on transmission to B, node D also initiates its transmission to
node A. At that time, node D is unaware of the transmission between A and B since it does not hear the
communication of A and B. Thus, node D sends a RTS frame to node A, which consequently leads to the
deafness problem. Due to the unfairness of the deafness problem (as shown in Figure <a

that node D could never obtain the channel if node C always has packets to send. However, this will not

<!--l. 988--><p class="indent" >  Compared with extensive studies on MAC layer of DAWNs, there are a smaller number of routing protocols dedicated to
directional antennas. Most of current routing protocols of DAWNs just simply adapt omni-directional routing protocols
to DAWNs. However, omni-directional routing protocols may not work well in DAWNs since directional
antennas have different characteristics from omni-directional antennas. For example, it is shown in <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XChoudhury:Yang">53</a>]</span> that
the network throughput significantly degrades due to the deafness when the routes have not been properly
designed.
<!--l. 992--><p class="indent" >  There are several new routing protocols proposed for DAWNs. In particular, we categorized directional routing protocols
into three types: pro-active, re-active and hybrid (which combine both pro-active and re-active mechanisms), as shown in
Table <a 
href="#x1-78r5">V<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:routing --></a>.
<!--l. 994--><p class="indent" >  DLSRP (directional link-state routing protocol) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XBandyopadhyay:routing">92</a>]</span> is a pro-active (table-driven) routing protocol, in which each node
must maintain a complete routing table of the entire network. Dir-LSRP <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRamanathan:2001">21</a>]</span> is another version of directional link-state
routing protocol, which has the similar performance of DLSRP. ESPAR-routing <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRoy:2003">65</a>]</span> is an improved DLSRP with load
balancing. One of disadvantages of these table-driven routing protocols is the cost for maintaining the routing table at each
node, which requires sending excessive node-updating messages. Besides, this type of protocols has a slower reaction on
network failures.
<!--l. 996--><p class="indent" >  ORDA (On-demand Routing using Directional Antennas) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XNasipuri:icccn2000">93</a>]</span> is one of the early studies on re-active directional
routing. In particular, ORDA constraints the route request to a certain narrow angle to avoid flooding extensive messages.
ARC-AODV <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTakai:Zhou">66</a>]</span> is a directional AODV (Ad Hoc On Demand Vector) protocol with adaptive range control. DAODV <span class="cite">
&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XHu:IET2008">97</a>]</span> is another version of directional AODV. In both ARC-AODV and DAODV, route requests (RREQs) are
broadcast and flooded in the entire network when the route between the source and the destination is still
unknown. Then, the route is set up when route replies (RREPs) are relayed back from the destination to the
source.
<!--l. 999--><p class="indent" >  Directional Dynamic Source Routing (DDSR) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XChoudhury:routing">94</a>]</span> is also an on-demand routing protocol. When a node has data
packets to send and the routing path to the destination is unknown, it will initiate routing discovery by flooding route
request packets to its neighbors. Then each node that receives an RREQ packet will re-broadcast the RREQ until it reaches
the destination. The main drawback of DDSR is that the sweeping delay due to directional broadcasting may lead to
sub-optimality of routing paths. This is because to sweep antenna beams leads to the neighbors of a node to get the same
RREQ at different points of time (i.e., the shortest delay does not means the shortest path). Besides, DDSR also suffers
from flooding excessive packets to maintain the network when there are many broken links at intermediate nodes (due to
the deafness).
<!--l. 1001--><p class="indent" >  Li et al. propose an improved DDSR (Multi-path Directional DSR) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XLi:VTC2004">95</a>]</span>. This protocol shares the same routing
discovery and maintenance scheme with DDSR while the routing table records multiple routing paths instead of a single
routing path. When a link is broken, the node can choose another link to route. However, MDDSR also requires excessive
messages to keep the network connected. DRP (Directional Routing Protocol) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XGossain:routing2006">96</a>]</span> is also a directional routing protocol
based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). But DRP has a better performance than DDSR since it has an enhanced routing
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
discovery mechanism.
<!--l. 1003--><p class="indent" >  All the on-demand routing protocols are suffering from the high latency in routing finding and the overhead due to
excessive flooding routing messages.
<!--l. 1005--><p class="indent" >  In addition to pro-active routing protocols and re-active routing protocols, there are some hybrid routing protocols for
DAWNs. In particular, Ramanathan et al. <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XRamanathan:2005">31</a>]</span> propose a directional hazy sighted link-state (DHSLS) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSantivanez:mobihoc2001">98</a>]</span> <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XSantivanez:BBN2001">99</a>]</span>
routing protocol of WONs to DAWNs. DHSLS is made scale well to a large scale network (around 1000
nodes). More specifically, DHSLS establishes routing paths effectively while using the relatively small number
of messages to maintain the network connected. In order to achieve this, DHSLS limits the propagation
of updating link states through carefully setting the dissemination radius of messages. However, DHSLS
does  not  consider  the  sweeping  delay  and  the  impacts  of  the  hidden  terminal  problem  and  the  deafness
problem.

<!--l. 1018--><p class="indent" >  Most of current directional routing protocols are based on existing ad hoc routing protocols, such as DSR and
AODV, which are mainly designed for omni-directional antennas. Since directional antennas have distinct
broadcasting features from omni-directional antennas (i.e., directional antennas have higher sweeping delay than
omni-directional antennas and directional antennas bring the new hidden terminals and the deafness problem), the
typical flooding mechanisms required by DSR and AODV may not perform well in DAWNs. Besides, some
practical studies, such as Roofnet <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XMorris:mobicom2005">100</a>]</span> have shown that some ad hoc routing protocols (e.g., DSR like
protocols) fail in practice due to the failure of neighboring nodes. To the best of our knowledge, there are quite
few studies on practical directional routing protocols (in fact, we have only found DHSLS works in real
test-beds). Moreover, most of current directional routing protocols are evaluated by simulations and not by real
experiments. Therefore, it is a big challenge to design routing protocols dedicated to directional antennas in
practice.

topology becomes unstable due to the frequent neighbor re-discovery and routing updates. The current solutions may not
apply to the mobile environments since they have significant overheads to maintain the routes. For example, DDSR requires
excessive messages to keep the network connected. Besides, nodes need to conduct neighbor discovery frequently due the
mobility of the network while the current neighbor discovery schemes are inefficient. For example, AoA
caching is quite slow to response to the unstable network. Synchronized TR-BF requires many rounds of
beam-scanning algorithms for neighbor discovery. MMAC requires sending excessive control packets to establish a
Dir-Dir link. Therefore, more effective routing protocols adaptive to mobile environments are expected in the
future.

improve the network capacity. However, routing protocols need to be re-designed for such networks. The first reason is that
there are multiple routing paths available at each node equipped with multiple interfaces. It might be un-necessary to
consider the sweeping delay of antenna beams since the multiple antennas at a node can be simultaneously active. The new
challenges with the multi-channel and multi-interface networks lie in the channel assignment scheme with directional
antennas. Secondly, the hidden terminal problem and the deafness problem might be completely solved through
using multiple channels. Therefore, the broken path due to the deafness or the hidden terminal might be
bridged and consequently more routing paths become available. In addition to the current criteria/metrics (e.g.,
the minimum end-to-end delay and the reliability of the routing path), other metrics, such as the minimum
number of channels or the minimum power consumption should also be considered in the design of routing
protocols.

<!--l. 1055--><p class="indent" >  Transport Control Protocol (TCP) have been widely used in the transport layer of either wired networks or wireless
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
networks. The main purpose of designing TCP is to provide a reliable, infrastructure-independent transport control protocol
with end-to-end flow control as well as congestion control mechanisms over the network layer. In particular, TCP
should be un-aware whether Internet Protocol (IP) is running over wired connections or wireless connections <span class="cite">
&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XHanbali05asurvey">101</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 1057--><p class="indent" >  TCP performs well in wired networks with incorporating congestion control mechanisms as well as flow control scheme.
However, TCP does not perform well in practical wireless ad hoc networks mainly due to the following reasons: (i)
mis-interpretation of packet losses, (ii) broken routing path, (iii) the contention of wireless channel, and (iv) the unfairness.
In particular, in wired networks, the packet losses are mainly due to the congestion. However, in wireless networks, many
reasons can lead to the packet losses. For example, a wireless link often has a much higher BER (bit-error-rate) than a
wired link. Besides, the collisions due to the wireless hidden terminal problem also result in the packet losses.
Moreover, the wireless routing path is less reliable than a wired one due to the mobility of wireless nodes,
the fading wireless channel and the high interference of wireless links. These facts affect both WONs and
DAWNs.
<!--l. 1059--><p class="indent" >  There are extensive studies on TCP enhancements over WONs, including Feedback-TCP <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XChandran98afeedback">102</a>]</span>, TCP with explicit link
failure notification (TCP-ELFN) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XHolland:1999">103</a>]</span>, TCP with buffering and sequence information (TCP-BuS) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XKim01tcp-bus:improving">104</a>]</span>,
and Ad hoc TCP (ATCP) <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xatcp:2001">105</a>]</span> et al. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are quite few studies
on transport layer control on DAWNs. In fact, to design a transport control protocol in DAWNs is more
challenging than that in WONs. As discussed in Section <a 
href="#x1-69r1">IV-A<!--tex4ht:ref: impacts-routing --></a>, using directional antennas in wireless ad hoc
networks will bring challenges on routing, such as the sweeping delay, the new hidden terminal problem
and the deafness problem. All these impacts should also be considered in the transport layer design in the
future.

<a 
 id="Q1-1-25"></a>
<!--l. 1070--><p class="indent" >  There are also some analytical models proposed to evaluate the performance of DAWNs. For example, Wang and
Garcia-Luna-Aceves <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XWang:2004">106</a>]</span> propose a performance model to evaluate the performance of directional MAC protocols which
are based on IEEE 802.11 DCF. In particular, a Markov chain model is used to represent the status of a node, in which a
node is always in <span 
class="ptmri7t-">Wait</span>, <span 
class="ptmri7t-">Succeed </span>or <span 
class="ptmri7t-">Fail </span>(i.e., a heavy traffic assumption). Besides, this model also approximates the
performance of the protocol in the time-slotted mode as that in the asynchronous mode so that the analysis can
be simplified. Carvalho and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XCarvalhoG06">107</a>]</span> present a general evaluation model of DAWNs, in
which a realistic antenna model and various carrier-sensing mechanisms including DVCS are taken into
account.
<!--l. 1072--><p class="indent" >  As mentioned in Section <a 
href="#x1-61r3">III-C<!--tex4ht:ref: comparison-DMAC --></a>, most of current DAWNs are evaluated by simulations and only few of them are evaluated
by real experiments on test-beds. Compared with WONs that are supported by many simulators, there are relatively fewer
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
simulators that can support directional antennas.
<!--l. 1074--><p class="indent" >  Table <a 
href="#x1-87r6">VI<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:simulator --></a> presents a brief comparison of current simulators that can support directional antennas (either build-in
support or 3rd party support). Note that we just compare the latest version of simulators, e.g., NS-2 (2.34) <span class="cite">
&#x00A0;[<a

QualNet 5.0 <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XQualNet:2010">110</a>]</span> and OPNET Modeler 15.0 <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XOPNET:2010">111</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 1076--><p class="indent" >  Compared with commercial simulators (e.g., QualNet, OPNET Modeler and EstiNet), NS-2 and GloMoSim do not offer
the build-in support for directional antennas although some 3rd party versions (e.g., the enhanced network simulator
(TENS)<span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTENS:2011">109</a>]</span>) can support directional antennas. Besides, although most of these simulators offer IEEE 802.11 MAC with
DCF, only QualNet can support directional MAC protocol, i.e., DVCS. In addition, all these simulators do not support
directional routing protocols (e.g., ARC-AODV <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XTakai:Zhou">66</a>]</span> and DDSR <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XChoudhury:routing">94</a>]</span>). Moreover, the mobility of nodes is considered in
all these simulators.
<!--l. 1080--><p class="indent" >  One of major challenges in the studies on DAWNs is to compare various directional protocols on a common simulation
platform. This is because (A) there are quite few source codes available for directional MAC protocols; (B) open source
simulators are often complex and time-consuming for learning while commercial ones are quite expensive; (C)
the simulation results are not always consistent (mainly due to the continuous changes of simulator source
codes).

    and consequently improve the network capacity <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

<!--l. 1170--><p class="indent" >  DIRC <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XDIRC:2009">22</a>]</span> identifies the challenges in using directional antennas in indoor environments and proposes a system to solve
these challenges. In particular, DIRC optimizes the orientations of directional antennas with low computational overhead.
More specifically, a TDMA-based MAC protocol is proposed in DIRC and is proved to be more efficient than other
CSMA/CA-based MAC protocols. However, a drawback of DIRC is the centralized control mechanism, which limits the
scalability of DIRC. Besides, clients in DIRC are only equipped with omni-directional antennas, which have higher
interference than directional ones.
<!--l. 1172--><p class="indent" >  MiDAS <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a

passive patch directional antenna <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xtelex">114</a>]</span> is used in MiDAS. This antenna without RF chain is so small that it can be
mounted at small mobile devices. In particular, MiDAS studies the impacts of the rotation of mobile devices equipped with
miniature antennas and the behaviour of directional antennas in NLOS indoor environments. Besides, a heuristic algorithm
is proposed to address the antenna selection problem.
<!--l. 1174--><p class="indent" >  It is found in Speed <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xliu:2010">23</a>]</span> that there are significant network capacity improvements when both APs and clients are
equipped with directional antennas. Besides, it is also shown in Speed <span class="cite">&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xliu:2010">23</a>]</span> that a four-sector antenna with 35 <sup><span

one can provide 96<span 
class="cmr-10">% </span>coverage. Since to design a distributed antenna-orientation scheme is more challenging than a
centralized one (e.g., in DIRC), a greedy algorithm is proposed to incorporate with a reservation-based MAC protocol.
Experimental results show that Speed performs much better than the omni-directional systems (both APs
and clients are mounted with omni-directional antennas only) and just a little worse than the centralized
scheme.
<!--l. 1176--><p class="indent" >  In most of current indoor directional systems, routing is not addressed since the traffic is traversed through only one hop.
However, ad hoc multi-hop routing in indoor directional systems may be worthwhile to study in the future since the traffic
will take more than one hop to route in some emerging applications.

<!--l. 1198--><p class="indent" >  Using directional antennas in wireless networks can bring numerous benefits, such as the reduced interference, the
extended communication range and the improved network capacity. However, the self-limitations of directional antennas
restrict the wide applications of them from wireless networks. In this paper, we present a classification of research
challenges on different protocol layers in DAWNs. In particular, the following research issues are expected to be addressed
in the future studies.
    <ul class="itemize1">
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Impact of directionality</span>. One of challenges brought by directional antennas is the localization and the neighbor
    discovery due to the beamforming. It is much harder to let the transmitter or the receiver to adjust the antenna
    beam  toward  each  other  in  the  Dir-Dir  mode  than  that  in  the  Dir-Omni  mode  and  the  Omni-Omni  mode.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    Although synchronized beam-scanning algorithms can solve the blind discovery, it is still a challenge to apply it
    in a decentralized network without strict time synchronization. Although the multi-hop RTS routing algorithm
    offers a solution to the blind discovery without synchronization, it requires transmitting multiple control frames
    to establish a Dir-Dir link, which bring significant overheads.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">The  hidden  terminal  problem  and  the  deafness  problem  </span>due  to  the  beamforming.  Both  the  hidden  terminal
    problem  and  the  deafness  problem  significantly  affect  the  network  performance  in  both  the  MAC  layer  and
    the  routing  layer.  There  are  a  number  of  MAC  protocols  proposed  to  address  the  problems.  However,  the
    overhead incurred by the MAC protocols is un-neglectable since many of them require sending multiple control
    frames for one data transmission and some of them require sending tones on other channels through an extra
    omni-directional antenna. Light-weight and efficient MAC protocols are expected in the future.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Cross-layer  design  in  DAWNs</span>.  Research  issues  on  one  layer  in  DAWNs  can  affect  the  protocol  design  on
    other  layers.  For  example,  impacts  of  the  hidden  terminal  problem  and  the  deafness  problem  can  affect  not
    only the MAC layer but also the routing layer and the transport layer. Therefore, in order to achieve superior
    performance  of  DAWNs,  it  is  critical  to  design  and  develop  MAC  protocols,  routing  schemes  and  transport
    protocols together in the future.
    </li>
    <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Indoor  systems</span>.  The  presence  of  multipath  fading  and  scattering  leads  to  the  challenges  to  use  directional
    antennas in wireless indoor systems. In particular, to adjust the orientations of indoor directional antennas to
    avoid interference is more challenging due to the significantly increased state space of the antenna directions
    in constructing the conflict graph. Therefore, to design an optimal algorithm with low computational overhead
    is crucial during the construction of indoor directional systems.
    </li></ul>
